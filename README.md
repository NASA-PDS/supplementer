# Supplementer

Supplementer is a tool to ingest supplemental metadata for Planetary Data System (PDS) products into a PDS Registry. 


## Documentation

You can find documentation for the latest release of the Supplementer tool, including installation and operation 
at https://nasa-pds.github.io/pds-registry-app/




## Build

You need JDK 11 and Maven to build this project. To create distribution package, run
```
mvn package
```

### Dependencies on other PDS Projects

- https://github.com/NASA-PDS/pds4-jparser - PDS label data table parser.
- https://github.com/NASA-PDS/pds-registry-common - Elasticsearch client, date conversion.

## Installation

- Either download binary release (ZIP or TGZ archives) from https://github.com/NASA-PDS/supplementer/releases
or, if you built the project yourself, get the ZIP or TGZ archive from "target" directory.
- Extract the archive to any folder, such as /home/pds


## Usage

Go to "bin" folder in the installation directory and run `supplementer` without any parameters to see the help screen.


### Example 1: 

Load supplemental data from Product_Metadata_Supplemental label into local registry (Elasticsearch)
```
supplementer load-labels /home/user1/data/prod_supplemental_1.xml
```

### Example 2: 

Load supplemental data from a list of Product_Metadata_Supplemental labels generated by Harvest

Harvest generates `supplemental.txt` file with a list of Product_Metadata_Supplemental label files in its output directory. Content of `supplemental.txt` file might look like this:
```
/home/user1/data/my_supplemental_label.xml
/home/user1/data/another_supplemental_product.xml
```

To load this list into local registry, run the following command:
```
supplementer load-labels /tmp/harvest/out/supplemental.txt
```
